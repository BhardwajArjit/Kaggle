## Introduction

Kaggle is a popular platform for data science and machine learning enthusiasts. It hosts a variety of datasets, competitions, and kernels (Jupyter notebooks) created by its community members. This repository serves as a centralized location to store and share my Kaggle notebooks with the wider community.

Feel free to explore the notebooks, use them as references for your own projects, and provide feedback or suggestions.

## Notebook Structure

The notebooks in this repository are organized as follows:

- **Competition Notebooks**: These notebooks are created for specific Kaggle competitions. They contain data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning models tailored to the competition's problem statement.

- **Personal Projects**: These notebooks showcase personal data analysis or machine learning projects not associated with Kaggle competitions. They cover a wide range of topics and datasets.

Each notebook is self-contained and includes comments and explanations to make it easy for others to understand the code and analysis.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you can simply clone it to your local machine using the following command:
